# Schema Migration
The SchemaMigration class automates the migration of data from an SQLite database to MongoDB, preserving relationships and dependencies between tables through foreign key analysis. The migration involves:

Extracting the schema and table relationships.
Determining the order of table migrations based on dependencies.
Renaming columns for clarity during migration.
Transferring data from SQLite to MongoDB.

# Data Mapping
The SQL-to-NoSQL Query Translation and Execution System is designed to facilitate the execution of SQL queries on a NoSQL database. This is achieved by intercepting SQL queries, converting them to a NoSQL equivalent format, and executing them on a MongoDB database. The system comprises three core components: the Mediator, the Convert module, and the Database Metadata.
Enable seamless integration of SQL-based applications with NoSQL databases.
Translate SQL queries into NoSQL queries while preserving the semantic integrity of the operations.
Support CRUD operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Provide formatted results for easier integration with relational systems.

# Execution
Create DB in Sqlite with table structure and data.<br>
Run mongo db using mongod command in command prompt.<br>
Execute schema migration framework python code to migrate sqlite db data to mongo db.<br>
Execute mapping framework python code to to facilitate the execution of SQL queries on a NoSQL database. <br>
Execute sql2nosql_plot.py to validate performance of sqlite and mongodb transaction.<br>
